I have a deep passion for physics and have had a very rewarding five years sharing my love of the subject in the classrooms of this East London Comprehensive. I became a Specialist Leader in Education (SLE) for Physics in 2019, and in that role have **delivered many training and coaching sessions** supporting non-specialist physics teachers. **I was later awarded an “Expert Practitioner” award for outstanding mentoring of trainee teachers** by the University of Cantebury.

I’m proud that my A-level students’ progress has been recognised as being in the **top 10% nationally** (via ALPS) in 3 of the last 4 years. I have appeared on Radio 4 with my students discussing a collaborative project I ran with Queen Mary University.

**I am passionate about sustainability and social justice**. Last year, I proactively secured a £95k grant to improve the school’s energy efficiency with a lighting overhaul. I brought together a team of colleagues into a task group aimed at reducing energy, paper and plastic usage and formed a student group to give the student body agency in driving sustainable initiatives. **I care deeply about female and BAME representation in STEM subjects**, co-ordinating my school’s involvement in a pilot study with King’s College and the Institute of Physics which resulted in a 5-fold increase in female uptake of A-Level physics.

## Oil and Gas Technical Safety and Risk Engineer || Nuclear Technical Safety and Risk Consultant

4. Communication

As a risk consultant I worked with colleagues and embedded in client teams on **large, high-hazard and highly regulated process industry projects**. We were tasked with analysing complex systems using a breadth of techniques and software to assess risks associated with fault conditions, and thus demonstrate acceptability of risk to regulators. In these jobs—as in software development—**clear, unambiguous communication in complex contexts** was essential.
