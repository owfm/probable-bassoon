## StoneX, London

> fulltime, Nov 2020-present

StoneX is a Fortune 100 multinational which provides commodity trading services to a wide variety of clients. As a member of the development team supporting the metals front office, my role has mainly been on greenfield projects developing services in support of the base- and precious-metal trading and operations staff.

### Selected projects:

- **Credit Optimisation Tool**: Full stack design and development of a data exploration tool with React/Typescript UI and a backend cache/query layer. The tool affords front-office staff excellent visibility of their client accounts, allowing them to explore allocation of credit lines in comparison with revenue via a rich search, aggregation and filtering interface. I built pipelines to ingest and warehouse data from multiple business divisions, and incorporated a fast, flexible query and aggregation framework to power the frontend. The first phase release of this tool has been hugely successful, and I was asked to present it the CEO and executive committee as a potential strategic tool to be expanded and rolled out to other business lines.

1. React / Express (TypeScript)
1. K8S
1. Highcharts
1. SQL, MongoDB, Postgres

- **TradeX UI**: I did a significant re-write of the frontend for the MVP of a new Trade Execution platform, including live metal price-streaming from liquidity providers

1. LightStreamer

- **Multi-stage CI/CD Pipelines**: I did a complete re-write of our team's CI/CD pipelines, moving from a largely manual PR/test/release process to one that is now full automated. I worked hard to improve DX, greatly improving the consistency and ease of onboarding microservices to our CI/CD infrastructure.

1. Azure DevOps
2. CI/CD
3. Docker

- **Trade Blotter**: A React micro-frontend allowing the user to perform complex search queries on a trade information API, which is then presented to the user in a sortable/filterable/searchable table view.

1. React
1. Typescript
1. AG-Grid

- **SonarQube Integration**: I have overseen our team's integration with SonarQube for static code-checking and code-quality checks, incorporating it into our PR and CI/CD workflow.

- **Confluent Cloud Migration** I oversaw our team's migration from on-prem Kafka instances to using Confluent Cloud, including designing and implementing a strategy for versioning and compatibility checks in our CI/CD pipelines
